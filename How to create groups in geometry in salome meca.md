Of course. I'd be happy to explain. You have identified the single most difficult problem in Salome scripting, and understanding this solution is the key to automating almost anything.

### The Problem: Why Hard-Coded IDs Fail

You are exactly right. When you perform operations in the Salome GUI, like a partition, Salome creates new geometric objects. Internally, it assigns them an "ID number".

If you partition a box into 4 layers, you get 4 new solids. In one session, their IDs might be `[2, 1718, 4752, 6908]`. If you close Salome, re-open it, and run the *exact same script*, the IDs might be `[5, 94, 312, 500]`.

This is because the IDs are temporary and depend on the current state of the Salome session. **You can never rely on a specific ID number being the same twice.** A script that says `geompy.UnionIDs(my_group, [1718])` is guaranteed to fail eventually.

### The Solution: The "Identify and Sort" Recipe

The solution is to **stop thinking about unpredictable IDs** and start thinking about **permanent, predictable properties**.

We know that no matter what their internal IDs are, the layers will always have a physical position in space. The bottom layer will always have the lowest Z-coordinate, and the top layer will always have the highest. We can use this fact to create a reliable recipe.

Here is the simple, three-step recipe our script uses:

1.  **Get All:** After the partition, we ask Salome for a list of *all* the solid objects inside the new `Partition_1` object. We get a jumbled, unsorted list of shapes. We don't know which is which.
2.  **Identify & Sort:** We loop through this jumbled list. For each solid, we calculate a unique, predictable property: the **Z-coordinate of its center of gravity**. We then sort the list of solids based on this Z-value, from lowest to highest. Now we have a perfectly ordered list where the first item is *guaranteed* to be the bottom layer, the second is the next layer up, and so on.
3.  **Loop and Create Groups:** We now loop through our **newly sorted list**. In each step of the loop, we know exactly which layer we are working with. We can then ask Salome, "What is the ID of *this specific object right now*?" and use that temporary ID to create our named group.

This way, we get the unpredictable ID at the very last second, only after we've positively identified the object using its permanent geometric properties.

### A Simple Example: A Box with 3 Layers

Imagine we partition a box and get 3 new solid layers. Let's call them `Solid_A`, `Solid_B`, and `Solid_C` just for this example.

**Step 1: Get All**

We run `all_solids = geompy.SubShapeAll(Partition_1, geompy.ShapeType["SOLID"])`.

Salome gives us a jumbled list. We don't know the order.
`all_solids` = `[Solid_A, Solid_B, Solid_C]`

**Step 2: Identify & Sort (The Magic Step)**

We loop through this list and calculate the Z-coordinate of the center of each solid.
*   Center of `Solid_A` is at Z = 25
*   Center of `Solid_B` is at Z = 5
*   Center of `Solid_C` is at Z = 15

Now, we create a new list of pairs `(Z-coordinate, Solid_Object)`:
`layers_with_z` = `[ (25, Solid_A), (5, Solid_B), (15, Solid_C) ]`

Finally, we **sort this list** based on the Z-coordinate:
`sorted_layers` = `[ (5, Solid_B), (15, Solid_C), (25, Solid_A) ]`

**Now we have a perfectly ordered list!** We know for a fact that `Solid_B` is the bottom layer, `Solid_C` is the middle, and `Solid_A` is the top.

**Step 3: Loop and Create Groups**

We loop through our `sorted_layers` list.

*   **Loop 1 (i=0):**
    *   The shape is `Solid_B`.
    *   The name will be `layer_1`.
    *   We ask Salome: `geompy.GetSubShapeID(Partition_1, Solid_B)`. Let's say Salome tells us the ID is `[94]`.
    *   We create the group: `geompy.UnionIDs(layer_group, [94])`. The group `layer_1` is now correctly created.

*   **Loop 2 (i=1):**
    *   The shape is `Solid_C`.
    *   The name will be `layer_2`.
    *   We ask Salome: `geompy.GetSubShapeID(Partition_1, Solid_C)`. Salome says the ID is `[5]`.
    *   We create the group: `geompy.UnionIDs(layer_group, [5])`. The group `layer_2` is correct.

*   **Loop 3 (i=2):**
    *   The shape is `Solid_A`.
    *   The name will be `layer_3`.
    *   We ask Salome: `geompy.GetSubShapeID(Partition_1, Solid_A)`. Salome says the ID is `[312]`.
    *   We create the group: `geompy.UnionIDs(layer_group, [312])`. The group `layer_3` is correct.

This process works every single time, because it relies on the geometry's physical position, not on the temporary, internal IDs that Salome uses. This is the fundamental technique for robustly scripting Salome.
